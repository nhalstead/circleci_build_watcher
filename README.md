## Circle CI Build Watcher

This is a simple tool to watch what builds are running on CircleCI and allow you to open directly to that build.

This tool is a small window that will open up and connect to the CircleCI API using your [API Token from your Account](https://circleci.com/account/api)
  and return the following information in a handy UI.
  
 - Build Status
 - Build Number
 - Author
 - Repository & Branch
 - Pull Request (If present)
 
 This tool supports using multiple circle CI accounts/token for when you have many organizations you need to watch builds on.
